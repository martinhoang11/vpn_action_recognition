# Skeleton-based Action Recognition using VPN
This is a project in Vin Big Data Institute's AI talent nurturing program. We re-use the author's code to solve our problems and try to improve it.

## Some notes
I had to modify the codes of VPN for the latest version of Keras and also for my project. The detail will be provided soon.
